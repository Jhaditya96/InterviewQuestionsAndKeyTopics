Search Engines work in stages:

Step 1: Crawling
>Search engines have a number of computer programs called web crawlers (thus the word Crawling), that are responsible for finding 
 information that is publicly available on the Internet.

>To simplify a complicated process, it’s enough for you to know that the job of these software crawlers 
 (also known as search engine spiders), is to scan the Internet and find the servers (also known as webservers) hosting websites.

>They create a list of all the webservers to crawl, the number of websites hosted by each server and then start work.

>They visit each website and by using different techniques, they try to find out how many pages they have, whether it is text content, 
 images, videos or any other format (CSS, HTML, javascript, etc).

>When visiting a website, besides taking note of the number of pages they also follow any links (either pointing to pages within the 
 site or to external websites), and thus they discover more and more pages.

>They do this continuously and they also keep track of changes made to a website so that they know when new pages are added or deleted, 
 when links are updated, etc.

Q. Why care about the crawling process?
Soln. Your first concern when optimizing your website for search engines is to ensure that they can access it correctly otherwise if they 
	  cannot ‘read’ your website, you shouldn’t expect much in terms of high rankings or search engine traffic.

	  There are a number of things to do to make sure that crawlers can discover and access your website in the fastest possible way 
	  without problems.

   	(1)Use Robots.txt to specify which pages of your website you don’t want crawlers to access. For example, pages like your admin or 
       	backend pages and other pages you don’t want to be publicly available on the Internet.
	
	(2)Big search engines like Google and Bing, have tools (aka Webmaster tools),  you can use to give them more information about your 
		website (number of pages, structure, etc) so that they don’t have to find it themselves.
	
	(3)Use an XML sitemap to list all important pages of your website so that the crawlers can know which pages to monitor for changes 
		and which to ignore.



Step 2: Indexing

>Crawling alone is not enough to build a search engine.

>Information identified by the crawlers needs to be organized, sorted and stored so that it can be processed by the search engine 
 algorithms before made available to the end-user.

>This process is called Indexing.

>Search engines don’t store all the information found on a page in their index but they keep things like: when it was created/updated, 
 title and description of the page, type of content, associated keywords, incoming and outgoing links and a lot of other parameters 
 that are needed by their algorithms.

Q.Why care about the indexing process?
Soln. It’s very simple, if your website is not in their index, it will not appear for any searches.
	This also implies that the more pages you have in the search engine indexes, the more are your chances of appearing in the search 
	results when someone types a query.
						In order to appear in the first 5 positions of the SERPs (search engine results pages), you have to optimize 
	your website for search engines using a process called Search Engine Optimization or SEO in short.

Step 3: Ranking
>Search Engine Ranking Algorithms

>The third and final step in the process is for search engines to decide which pages to show in the SERPS and in what order when someone 
 types a query.

>This is achieved through the use of search engine ranking algorithms.

>In simple terms, these are pieces of software that have a number of rules that analyze what the user is looking for and what information
 to return.

>These rules and decisions are made based on what information is available in their index.

Q.How do search engine algorithms work?
Soln. Over the years search engine ranking algorithms have evolved and became really complex.
								At the beginning (think 2001) it was as simple as matching the user’s query with the title of the page but 
	  his is no longer the case.
								Google’s ranking algorithm takes into account more than 255 rules before making a decision and nobody knows 
	  for sure what these rules are.
